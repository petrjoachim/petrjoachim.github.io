        <p>
          After 10 year in IT industry I decided to close my career as a developer and manager.
          Instead I've chosen to be a coach and to work with people on more individual level.
          I work both with individuals and whole teams. My usual topics are about processes, methods and habits
          both in personal and professional space.
          After years I've acquired experience with agile methodologies and I've been through several management courses.
          I study time management and other self-development topics in my free time.
